# Crypto-Project
Final Project

# Setup
This code was developed with Python 3.7, you may be able to get by with Python 3.6 and below, but for best results please use Python 3.7.

No external libraries are needed aside from the base Python libraries.

To run:
1. `$ python3 server.py`
2. `$ python3 client.py`

Give it a couple seconds to handshake, then you can send messages back and forth between client and server.

To terminate the connection, either the client or server can send the message "quit".
